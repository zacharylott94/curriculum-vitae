# Hey There!

This repo is acting as a blog spot for me. The goal of this project is to serve as a central location for me to write about anything I happen to be working on. **This is not a professional CV.** I feel like I do some pretty interesting stuff sometimes, but I can never really remember what it was. Blog entries will be held in the `corpus` folder and will be named with a timestamping format of YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM. It should be easy to peruse the latest entry this way.

Oh! By the way, this repo is an Obsidian vault. It's possibly my favorite piece of freeware. Check it out [here](https://obsidian.md)! 
I chose Obsidian for a few reasons:
- It uses markdown and so does github, making it easy to host there.
- It has good searchability.
- I don't want the overhead of a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
- I like Obsidian :)
