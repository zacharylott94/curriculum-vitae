# What's the Point of This Repo?

I got inspired one night (stayed up too late and couldn't sleep because I was thinking too much) to start a blog about anything interesting I'm working on in my life. This will mostly end up being hobbies or other non-professional activities. To any recruitment officers seeing a repo labelled "curriculum-vitae" and thinking this is a professional document, **it isn't.** I just thought the Latin made sense for the intent of this blog. If I stick with this project, this will literally be a documentation of my "life's journey" at least in the sense of "How I Spend My Free Time".
