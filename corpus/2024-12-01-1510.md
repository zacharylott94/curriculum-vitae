# Pouring Tea Cups
A few months ago, I printed a positive to cast a plaster mold to cast ceramic tea cups. I've been putting off pouring a set, but right now is as good as a time as ever.

The first step is to mix down out slip. Slip is just clay and water. We have a bucket of it from wheel projects or recycled greenware.

I screen it to remove clumps, but it looks like this batch is fairly watery and smooth. I didn't have any clumping.

We have the slip and the mold, so time to pour it in.

And now we wait.

Here's the mold with the slip poured out and a layer of clay deposited.

I cut it around the outside to keep it from sticking on the mold on the side I poured from.

I would have liked to measure the volume and mass of the slip to get a density for reproducibility, but I am unfortunately under-equipped. The idea would have been that if I match the density and the time that I leave the slip in the mold, I can know how thick the clay deposit will be and be able to get that same thickness in the future. In the end, making something is the goal, and I am one step closer to making something. Future steps will involve de-molding the cups, trimming them, letting them dry, firing them, glazing them, and then firing them again.
